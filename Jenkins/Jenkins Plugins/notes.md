# Jenkins Plugins
Jenkins has plugins which allows you to connect Jenkins to other services. For example, if you want to use Jenkins to deploy docker images to DockerHub, you can install and configure the Docker plugin. The plugins can be found under the Manage Jenkins section. Some plugins require Jenkins to restart.

When you install a plugin, there may be some new settings which you can configure in the Manage Jenkins section such as credentials. Some additional settings might also be added when creating a new Jenkins job.
