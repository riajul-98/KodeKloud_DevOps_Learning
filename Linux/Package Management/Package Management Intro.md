# Package Management Introduction
There are hundreds of Linux distributions and one of the common ways to categorise a distribution is by the package manager it uses. For example, RHEL, CentOS and Fedora are based on RPM, meaning they are an RPM-based distribution. Ubuntu, Debian and Linux Mint are based on Debian package managers such as dpkg, hence they are Debian based packages.

## RHEL and CentOS
CentOS is very similar to RHEL. CentOS is a community-driven enterprise operating system, which is forked from Red Hat. Red Hat is only available through paid subscription but comes with much more features such as technical support and quicker access to latest features.

## Package
A package is a compressed archive which contains all the files which are required by a particular software to run. Packages also include a manifest which lists the dependancies which a software may need as well as version numbers of them dependancies. This is included as different distributions run differently and will need different softwares, libraries and tools to run these correctly. 

## Package Manager
A package manager is a software in a Linux system that provides a consistent and automated process or installing, upgrading, configuring and removing packages from the operating system. Some of the essential functions of a package manager are:

- Package integrity and authenticity
- Simplifying package management process
- Grouping packages by function
- Managing dependancies
